          </p>
          <p>
            We may also process your personal data based on any legitimate
            interest or to comply with any legal obligations. These interests
            and obligations may include the exercise or defence of legal claims
            or to comply with an order of any court, tribunal, authority, or

          </p>
          <p>
            Generally, We do not rely on consent as a legal basis for processing
            your personal data. However, where your consent is required, We will
            provide you with a form requesting explicit consent to do so.
          </p>

          <h2>7. Marketing</h2>
          <p>
            You will receive marketing communication if you have requested such
            information from Us by providing Us with your details through this
            Website and have consented and opted-in to receiving such

          </p>

          <h2>8. Disclosure of your personal data</h2>
          <p>
            We may be required to share your data with local agents or other
            service suppliers (in their capacity as data processors), which is
            necessary for Us to provide the services you request. These local
            agents and suppliers store and process your data based on strict
            confidentiality and are subject to the appropriate security measures
            and safeguards.
          </p>
          <p>
            We may also share your data with other third parties in their
            capacity as data controllers, such as legal, tax, real estate,
            immigration or other advisors and consultants, (international) banks
            for payment details, or third parties providing other or additional
            services or goods to you such as real estate agencies, owners, or
            developers who you might wish to engage with under separate terms
            and conditions between you and such third parties. These third
            parties will process your data in their own right as data
            controllers, and their data protection policies and processes shall
            become applicable.
          </p>
          <p>
            We may also disclose or share your data if We are under a duty to do
            so to comply with any legal obligation or judgment or under an order
            from a court, tribunal, or authority. We may also disclose your data
            to enforce Our terms of use or to protect Our rights, property, or
            safety, that of Our partners or other users of Our Website. This
            includes exchanging information with other companies and
            organizations for the purposes of anti-money laundering or KYC
            checks, compliance with anti-bribery or corruption laws, and/or
            fraud protection.
          </p>

          <h2>9. Transfers of data to third countries</h2>
          <p>
            Where We share your personal data with internal or external third
            parties, this may involve transferring your data outside Turkey. We
            will transfer your personal data in accordance with standard
            contractual clauses to ensure that your personal data is protected
            and transferred securely in compliance with applicable laws.

          <h2>10. Third-party access to your personal data</h2>
          <p>

            you request on Our Website. These third parties include cloud
            storage providers, analytics providers, and search engine
            information providers. We will only work with third-party providers
            that comply with applicable laws in the jurisdictions in which We
            operate.
          </p>

          <h2>11. Data security</h2>
          <p>
            We will ensure that appropriate security measures are taken against
            unlawful or unauthorized processing of personal data and the
            accidental loss of or damage to personal data. In addition, We limit
            access to your personal data to those employees, agents, contractors
            and other professional third parties who strictly need to know this
            information. They will only process your personal data on Our
            instructions and are subject to a duty of confidentiality. All of
            Our employees and agents have received appropriate training on data
            protection.
          </p>
          <p>
            The transfer of information between Our Website and your device is
            protected with transport layer security (TLS) certificates. When the
            Website is accessed using compatible browsers, that technology
            protects personal information using both server authentication and
            data encryption to ensure that personal information is safe and
            secure while in transit.
          </p>
          <p>
            All personal data is stored in a secure server environment that uses
            a firewall and other advanced technology to protect against
            interference or unauthorized access. Usernames and passwords are
            issued to persons authorized to access the personal data, such as
            Our employees, who are bound by confidentiality not to disclose any
            personal data.
          </p>
          <p>
            No data transmission method is 100% secure, and absolute security
            cannot be guaranteed.
          </p>

          <h2>12. Data retention</h2>
          <p>
            We shall only store your data as long as it is strictly necessary
            for the purposes for which it was collected (that is, to provide you
            with Our services or to satisfy any legal, accounting, or reporting
            requirements).
          </p>
          <p>
            We will only retain your personal data for as long as necessary to
            fulfil the purposes for which We collected it (the provision of the
            Services and the ongoing performance of Our professional
            relationship with you) and, thereafter, for the purpose of
            satisfying any legal, accounting, tax, anti-money laundering and
            regulatory reporting requirements or obligations to which We may be
            subject and/or to the extent that We may also need to retain your
            personal data to be able to assert, exercise or defend possible
            future legal claims against or otherwise involving you.
          </p>
          <p>
            By and large, Our retention of your personal data shall not exceed
            the period of six (6) years from the termination of your engagement
            with Company.
          </p>

          <h2>13. Data minimisation</h2>
          <p>
            Whenever and to the extent possible, We anonymize the data that We
            hold about you when it is no longer necessary to identify you from
            that data.
          </p>

          <h2>14. Your rights as a data subject</h2>
          <ol>

                <li>
                  Your personal data is no longer necessary in relation to the

                  Your personal data must be erased to comply with a legal
                  obligation to which We are subject.
                </li>
              </ul>
              Note, however, that We may not always be able to comply with your
              request of erasure for specific legal reasons, which will be
              notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request. These
              may include instances where the retention of your personal data is
              necessary to comply with a legal or regulatory obligation to which
              We are subject; or establish, exercise or defend a legal claim.

              <strong>The right to data portability.</strong> We will provide to
              you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a
              structured, commonly used, machine-readable format.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Right to withdraw consent.</strong> Where you may have
              provided your consent to the collection, processing, and transfer
              of your personal information for a specific purpose (for example,
              for marketing), you have the right to withdraw your consent for
              that specific processing at any time, or you may withdraw your
              consent to this Privacy Policy. Once We have received notification
              that you have withdrawn your consent, we will no longer process
              your information for that purpose unless We have another
              legitimate basis for doing so in law. Withdrawal of consent to
              this Privacy Policy will result in Us having to terminate Our
              services with you immediately.

          <h2>15. Law applicable to disputes</h2>
          <p>
            The Privacy Policy and its subject matter is governed by Turkey law.
            You hereby agree that the courts of Turkey shall have exclusive
            jurisdiction in relation to any claim, dispute or difference
            concerning the Engagement Letter and any matter arising from it.
            Each party irrevocably waives any right it may have to object to an
            action being brought in those courts, to claim that the action has
            been brought in an inconvenient forum, or to claim that those courts
            do not have jurisdiction.
          </p>

          <h2>16. Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2>
